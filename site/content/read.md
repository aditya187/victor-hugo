Most people don’t care about *readability* of an online article, few of us however, do. No matter how good the content is, if the website (and hence the article) is littered with inline ads, bad formatting, or even gaudy typography - I prefer not to read it as is. Here are some tips to get around such websites, and have a great reading experience.

I have divided the post in multiple levels: Level 0 is reading an article as is, no matter how crappy it looks, rest of levels are listed below.

## Level 1: Use adblocker

At a minimum use an adblocker wherever you can! It not only provides a better reading experience by blocking ads, but also saves network bandwidth and improves your security by blocking malicious websites.

On desktop, use adblocker in every browser you have. Additionally, you should use some privacy preserving plugins like Ghostery. I recommend researching some good, fast, private adblockers and choosing what works best for you.

On mobile-iOS, you can use adblockers for Safari as custom plugins.

On mobile-Android, Google is notorious for not allowing ad block plugins in Chrome (why would they, it directly conflicts with their ad empire after all). You still have a couple of options:
1. Use non-google browsers like Firefox/Samsung Internet which allow you to add custom ad blockers.

*Following options will provide ad blocking not just in web browsers, but also in most apps.*

2. Use an adblocker that creates a local VPN.
3. Use a VPN service that provides network level adblock protection like Surfshark, TunnerBear or NordVPN. 
4. Use DNS level ad blocking, like from [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io).
5. For advanced users, build a network level ad blocker like [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net).

I am a long time user of uBlock Origin adblocker. For an up to date list of tools and browser plugins I use, you can see this: [New Mac Setup - Docs](https://docs.daitya.info/macos/new-mac-setup)

## Level 2: Level 1 + User Reader Mode

Every major browser supports reader mode which strips away all formatting and presents an article in a consistent, clear interface. On one end, Safari’s reader most is the best IME, on the other end, Chrome makes it unnecessarily difficult to find but there is one.

To enable Chrome’s hidden reader mode: Visit `chrome://flags/#enable-reader-mode` in a new tab and simply **Enable** it. Or simply search and use any reader mode chrome extension.

## Level 3: Level 2 + Use Read Later services

Next level is using Read Later services like [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) or [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/). Both provide easy ways to add articles directly from your browsers, a clean beautiful interface and a slew of features like highlighting, offline reading, local copy, etc. on their premium tier. I recommend Instapaper over Pocket for its privacy and focus on reading (versus social/sharing aspects of Pocket).

## Level 4: Level 3 + RSS Readers

RSS readers provide an automatic way to keep up with latest content from your favorite sources or authors, and read it via an RSS reader app in a beautiful, clean interface. If you’re new, I suggest starting with a free app like [Feedly](https://feedly.com). I use [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) (subscription based) and a couple of RSS readers ([Unread](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unread-an-rss-reader/id1363637349), [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com)).
